- in latter parts of the auditory cortex, neurons encode the sensory evidence that forms an auditory decision and are causally involved in the decision process. Finally, in the prefrontal cortex, which receives input from the auditory cortex, neural activity reflects the actual perceptual decision. Together, these studies indicate that the ventral pathway contains hierarchical circuits that are specialized for auditory perception and scene analysis. ^de2ca8

monkey: 
- In rhesus monkeys, this pathway begins in core auditory cortex—specifically, primary auditory cortex (A1) and the rostral field. These core areas project to the middle lateral (ML) and anterolateral belt (AL) regions of auditory cortex. In turn, these belt regions project directly and indirectly to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC).

meta about dorsal: 
- It is important to briefly comment on the contribution of the dorsal (“spatial”) pathway to auditory perception (Rauschecker 2012; Cloutman 2013). Spatial information can act as a grouping cue to assist the segregation of an acoustic stimulus into discrete sounds. For example, when a rhythmic sequence of identical sound bursts is presented from a single location, it is often perceived as one source. ^05cbf9

A1 controversial: 
- A1's role in auditory perception is controversial. Part of that controversy stems from the putative role of A1 in processing auditory “objects” (Nelken 2008). We will take the position that auditory objects are analogous to perceptual representations (i.e., sounds) (Bizley and Cohen 2013).

- human-imaging studies have revealed that regions of core auditory cortex are modulated by listener's reports of the identity of an ambiguous speech sound.
- choice-related activity may not reflect a casual contribution of the auditory cortex to decision-making but may simply reflect feedback from higher choice-sensitive areas (Nienborg and Cumming 2009) or the structure of the correlated noise (Nienborg et al. 2012). ^9041cd
- We found that neither ML nor AL activity was modulated by the monkeys' choices
- Interestingly, as noted above, the dorsal pathway also contributes to auditory perception; consistent with that notion, activity in the human parietal lobe is modulated by listeners' choices (Cusack 2005). ^59d7b2

their model
- we propose a model in which auditory information is hierarchically organized and processed in the ventral pathway. In early parts of the auditory cortex, neural activity encodes the acoustic features of an auditory stimulus and become increasingly sensitive to complex spectrotemporal properties (Rauschecker and Tian 2000). In later regions of the auditory cortex, this information informs perceptual judgments.
- In core auditory cortex, neural activity codes the category membership of simple feature conjunctions. For example, categorical representations of frequency-contours have been identified (Ohl et al. 2001; Selezneva et al. 2006).
- Categories for more complex stimuli, such as speech sounds and vocalizations, can be found in the lateral belt (Chang et al. 2010; Steinschneider et al. 2011; Tsunada et al. 2011; Steinschneider 2013). For example, AL neurons respond categorically, and in a manner consistent with listeners' behavioral reports, to morphed versions of two speech sounds (“bad” and “dad”)
- superior temporal gyrus is categorically and hierarchically organized by speech sounds (Binder et al. 2000; Chang et al. 2010; Leaver and Rauschecker 2010): phoneme categories are found in the middle aspect; word categories in the anterior-superior aspect; and phrases in the most anterior aspect (DeWitt and Rauschecker 2012; Rauschecker 2012). ^5686c0
- vlPFC neurons represent the valence of food-related calls (e.g., high quality food vs. low quality food) (Gifford et al. 2005). That is, vlPFC neurons encode the “referential” information that is transmitted by vocalizations, independent of differences in their acoustic properties.
  
  ich glaube, das bezieht sich alles auf monkeys.
