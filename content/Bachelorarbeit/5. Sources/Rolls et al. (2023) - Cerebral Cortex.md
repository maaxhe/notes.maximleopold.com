Rolls brain is whole brain 

aber was wir machen wollen, 

general:
- the auditory cortex is described as having core (corresponding to primary and primarylike auditory cortex), then belt (which surrounds the core), and then parabelt fields, all of which contain several subfields
- Early Auditory division: Area 52, A1 Primary Auditory Cortex, LBelt Lateral Belt Complex, MBelt Medial Belt Complex, PBelt ParaBelt Complex, PFcm (which is part of the parietal cortex), and RI RetroInsular Area. Auditory Association division: A4 Auditory 4 Complex, A5 Auditory 5 Complex, TA2, STGa, STSda Area STS dorsal anterior, STSdp Area STS dorsal posterior, STSva Area STS ventral anterior, and STSvp Area STS ventral posterior. It is noted that the HCP-MMP atlas sometimes uses dorsal vs ventral as descriptors following nomenclature in non-human primates, and that these correspond to superior and inferior in humans.

belt and parabelt:
- belt neurons respond best to band-passed noise of a specific frequency and bandwidth; and parabelt neurons respond to increasingly complex sounds.

ventral:
- Consistent with this being a “what” ventral auditory stream, these STS regions then have effective connectivity to TPOJ1, STV, PSL, TGv, TGd, and PGi, which are language-related semantic regions connecting to Broca’s area, especially BA45.
- ventral auditory pathway is involved in the decoding of spectrally complex sounds (“auditory objects”), which includes the decoding of speech sounds ("speech perception") and their ultimate linking to meaning in humans.
- areas
	- STGa connects to part of Broca’s area, area 45 (Figs. 2-4). STGa is proposed to be part of a superior (i.e. anatomically dorsal) bank of the STS cortex semantic system including STSda and STSdp, which is involved in multimodal auditory and corresponding visual motion information
	- dorsal bank STS regions are therefore important in linking motion-related changes in the sight of the face to the dynamically changing auditory input, and this is likely to be useful for identifying who in a group is making the vocalization, in maximizing the ability to decode information in noisy environments in order to understand speech, in maximizing the information in social signals by combining the auditory and visual components, etc. In the sense that this processing provides evidence about what the message is, this could be considered as a type of ventral stream “what” semantic processing.
	- superior/dorsal bank STS
		- This “superior/dorsal bank STS cortex system” thus enables multimodal representations including visual, auditory, and probably also somatosensory via PGi, to gain access to the language system (Rolls et al. 2022e). This is a major output of cortical visual and auditory processing for use in language, described in more detail elsewhere

dorsal: 
- anatomy:
	- A4 and A5 also have effective connectivity to MT and MST, which connect to superior parietal regions forming a dorsal auditory “where” stream involved in actions in space. Connections of PBelt, A4, and A5 with BA44 may form a language-related dorsal stream.
	- Inferior parietal and premotor cortices are all part of this dorsal stream network
- tasks
	- An auditory dorsal pathway is involved in sensorimotor integration and control (Rauschecker 2011), and in humans plays a role in speech production as well as categorization of phonemes during speech processing (Rauschecker 2012).
	- it has presumably evolved as a substrate for sensorimotor processing, connecting sensory, and motor cortical systems with each other and the basal ganglia (Rauschecker 2018a; Archakov et al. 2020), thus permitting the learning of sequences and the origin of both language and music (Rauschecker 2018b).
	- functional connectivity, which is evident in Fig. 5 between A4, the PBelt, etc. and parietal 7AL, 7Am, and 7PC, and is also supported by the diffusion tractography showing connections between similar regions (Fig. 6). These auditory inputs to dorsal-stream parietal areas could be used to shift visual attention and eye position to a source of sound, to help track moving noisy objects such as f lying birds and predators (e.g. alarm calls for eagles versus snakes (Seyfarth and Cheney 2010)), or keeping track of the location of a predator when running away, and performing actions in the dark for objects that can be detected by their sound.

other regions: 
- issue arises of whether A5 is part of a dorsal or ventral auditory stream
- Lbelt, Pbelt, A4 and A5 have effective connectivity with MT/MST regions as indicated, and this may be part of a dorsal “where” stream leading to intraparietal and area 7 regions

V5
- auditory cortical region A5 has connectivity with inferior frontal gyrus regions IFJa and IFSp, which are implicated in short-term working memory for the ventral streams

PFC
- OFC/vmPFC
	- Moreover, neurons can respond to auditory stimuli such as vocalization both in the STS regions (Baylis et al. 1987) and in the orbitofrontal cortex, which receives connections from the STS (Rolls et al. 2006). The connectivity described here helps to provide a functional framework for the processing streams involved in these types of function.
	- Inputs related to reward and punishment from, for example, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (10r, 10v, 10d), and orbitofrontal cortex (a47r) (Rolls et al. 2022g) reach STS auditory–visual cortical regions where objects, faces, and their semantic meaning are represented (Rolls et al. 2022e), rather than earlier stages of auditory cortical processing (Figs. 2-4). Correspondingly, STS regions have effective connectivity with some orbitofrontal/vmPFC regions in which neurons respond to vocalization and the face movements that produce them
