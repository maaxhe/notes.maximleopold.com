- Selective attention is known to support both sound localization and recognition, but it is unclear how representations of auditory space and identity are top-down modulated in the human auditory cortex.

- double dissociation in response adaptation to sound pairs with phonetic vs. spatial sound changes, demonstrating that the human nonprimary auditory cortex indeed processes speech-sound identity and location in parallel anterior ‘‘what’’ (in anterolateral Heschl’s gyrus, anterior superior temporal gyrus, and posterior planum polare) and posterior ‘‘where’’ (in planum temporale and posterior superior temporal gyrus) pathways as early as 70 –150 ms from stimulus onset.  ^4f3ab3
- Our data further show that the ‘‘where’’ pathway is activated 30 ms earlier than the ‘‘what’’ pathway, possibly enabling the brain to use top-down spatial information in auditory object perception. ^0e5b5f
- accumulating evidence that nonprimary auditory cortex regions posterior to the Heschl’s gyrus (HG) are involved in spatial processing ^f05bb5
- Selective attention may thus be based on short-term plasticity of auditory cortex, increasing the neurons’ selectivity for relevant information, instead of simple amplification of neuronal responses (proposed to govern attentional modulation of visual cortices) (46, 56). Such featurespecific modulation of neuronal receptive fields by selective attention may facilitate adjustment and calibration of the perceptual system based on the particular acoustic environment and task requirements. ^5060f9
- **‘‘where’’ stream is activated significantly earlier ( 30 ms in ECD models) than the anterior ‘‘what’’ stream.**
	- the posterior auditory ‘‘where’’ pathway could accomplish rapid and coarse stimulus analysis required for shifting and maintaining attention to the features of a relevant auditory object (50), thus enabling the human brain to use top-down spatial information in auditory object perception.
	- anterolateral HG, parts of the anterior STG, and PP process auditory object identity and that regions posterior to HG, including parts of PT and posterior STG, process sound location features (see Fig. 2). ^dfae6d
