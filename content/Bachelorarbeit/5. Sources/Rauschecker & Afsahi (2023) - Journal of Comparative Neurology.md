- the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the rostral area (R), respond well to pure tones (PTs) and are narrowly tuned to frequency, whereas normal responsiveness at later stages of auditory cortical processing (area CM) depends on the integrity of the core
- anterolateral area (AL) projects to rostral parabelt (RB), and the caudolateral area (CL) projects to caudal parabelt (CB). In addition, a middle lateral area (ML) was found that projected to both RB and CB
- Injections into area AL led to label in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), whereas injections into area CL led to label in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)

pathways
- projection from AL in the auditory belt to VLPFC subserves the same purpose of object working memory as in the visual domain; and the projection from CL conveys auditory spatial information to support auditory spatial working memory

anteroventral
- anteroventrally directed pathway from rostral belt projects to VLPFC and provides the anatomical-physiological substrate for the identification of auditory objects

postero-dorsal
- postero-dorsal pathway from the caudal belt projects to DLPFC, providing the substrate for auditory spatial analysis: a ‘where’-stream.
- participation of posterior temporal and parietal cortices in auditory space processing
- Some of these and other studies also demonstrated a participation of DLPFC in spatial hearing (Belin et al., 2002; Lewald et al., 2008; Weeks et al., 2000)
- The current dorsal-stream model postulates that posterior parietal areas may serve as a relay station between auditory centers and the PMC
