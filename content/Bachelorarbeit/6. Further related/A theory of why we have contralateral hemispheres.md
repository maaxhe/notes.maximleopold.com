## A theory of why we have contralateral hemispheres

When I first learned about the brain, you are being told that the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body and vice versa. Back then I just accepted this fact. 

But why is it this way?

There are some theories about why this is the case and I find the visual map theory the most potent one. 

To understand why the brain evolved the way it did we should look into evolution. 

Back then when organisms were very simple and did not even have eyes, they still had to be able to avoid obstacles or enemies. 

... did not finish this article ... sadly
