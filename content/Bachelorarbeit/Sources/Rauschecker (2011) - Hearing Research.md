also es ist gar nicht so einfach, monkeys mit menschen zu vergleichen, weil die anatomy in beiden unterschiedlich ist - das lese ich daraus.

- The role of the antero-ventral auditory processing stream in auditory object identification, or as a “what”-pathway, has become largely undisputed
- role of the postero-dorsal auditory pathway for spatial hearing
- whereas monkeys use their dorsal stream for space processing, humans use it for speech
- Although it is common knowledge that brainstem mechanisms play an important role in the processing of spatial attributes of sounds (Irvine, 1992; King and Nelken, 2009; Knudsen and Konishi, 1978), early studies have also suggested a role for auditory cortex in sound localization (Diamond et al., 1956; Heffner and Masterton, 1975; Ravizza and Masterton, 1972).

in monkeys: 
- In rhesus monkeys, core areas A1 and R (the “primary” and “rostral” fields, respectively), are surrounded by secondary belt areas (Kaas and Hackett, 2000). Both lateral and medial belt (LB and MB) neurons respond better to band-passed noise bursts than to pure tones (Kusmierek and Rauschecker, 2009; Rauschecker et al., 1995). Comparing core and belt, spatially tuned neurons are present in A1 but are found at a much higher density in the caudo-medial belt field (CM) (Rauschecker et al., 1997; Recanzone, 2000). When monkeys are trained in an auditory localization task, the firing rate of neurons in CM correlates more tightly with behavioral performance than that of neurons in A1, which is a strong indication that CM plays an important role in sound localization (Recanzone et al., 2000). Such localization is most likely accomplished on the basis of a population code (Miller and Recanzone, 2009).
- Connectivity studies in rhesus monkeys (Rauschecker et al., 1997) have shown that at least one of the caudal belt regions receives its subcortical input via a separate pathway than core areas A1 and R.
