## Griffiths et al. (1998)
Griffiths, T. D., Rees, G., Rees, A., Green, G. G. R., Witton, C., Rowe, D., Büchel, C., Turner, R., & Frackowiak, R. S. J. (1998). Right parietal cortex is involved in the perception of sound movement in humans. _Nature Neuroscience_, _1_(1), 74–79. [https://doi.org/10.1038/276](https://doi.org/10.1038/276)

we have demonstrated human brain areas that are active specifically during the perception of sound movement. Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated the involvement of the right parietal cortex in sound movement perception with these stimuli.

A1:
- A1 was active during both tasks, but was not differentially activated by sound movement. No differential activation in A1 was demonstrated even if this area was treated as a region of interest for which a prior hypothesis existed, in which case statistical correction for multiple comparisons does not need to be made.

Parietal Cortex: 
- Another study15 demonstrated a dissociated deficit in sound movement detection due to a posterior right hemisphere lesion that was distinct from the auditory cortex.
- We therefore suggest that the posterior parietal activation we observe is due to perceptual processing of movement, rather than attention. Specifically, we hypothesize that a perceived representation of the stimulus movement exists in the posterior parietal cortex. This is in accord with neurophysiological studies suggesting a role for the posterior parietal cortex in the representation of abstract spatial information22.
- Neither the fMRI nor the PET experiments showed any increase in activation in auditory cortex during sound-movement perception. This is contrary to what might have been predicted from single-unit recordings in animals, showing neurons in the auditory cortex with selective responses to spatial sound cues
- The prefrontal areas receive projections from both ventral parietal cortex (area 7)33 and from area 7a/LIP in the monkey33,34. We suggest that the parietal areas, in conjunction with the prefrontal areas that we have demonstrated in the fMRI experiment, form a network involved in sound spatial perception and selective attention.
