We thus demonstrate anticipatory alpha oscillations to underlie top-down control of object-based auditory attention in complex naturalistic scenes.

subjects who were better prepared (i.e., attended better to the correct stream right before the repetition, as indicated by higher alpha classification accuracy) responded faster to the repetition. We did not observe such an effect for accuracy (Rho = 0.26, p = 0.35). Albeit speculative, these two results suggest a causal role for oscillatory alpha activity in object-based auditory attention since significant alpha classification earlier during the trial predicted subsequent behavioral performance.
