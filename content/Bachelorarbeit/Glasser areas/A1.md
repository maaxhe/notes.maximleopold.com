![[location and frequencies of primary auditory cortex.png]]

- same location in monkeys, A1 -> ML/AL ->vlPFC
AL/ML are here: [[auditory cortex ventral and dorsal stream monkey.png]]

Quelle: [[Cohen et al. (2016) - Springer]]
### Functions

- highest myelination, also highest FC with MGN (Medial Geniculate Nucleus) -> therefore primary source for auditory signals from lower areas as the MGN


Before A1 in lower areas
