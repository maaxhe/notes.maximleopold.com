**Stream:**
**Classical equivalent:**
**Mapped to Glasser:** These areas are part of the Auditory Association Cortex: [[A4]], [[A5]], [[STSdp]], STSda, [[STSvp]], STSva, [[STGa]], and [[TA2]] ([[Glasser et al. (2016) - Nature#^eb989b]])

## Anatomical location
a region mainly on the [[STG]] and within the [[STS]] that is activated in the LANGUAGE STORY, MATH, and STORY-MATH contrasts. ([[Glasser et al. (2016) - Nature#^476d27]])

## Function(s)
- becomes likely progressively less purely auditory and more multi-modal as one progresses inferiorly, anteriorly, and posteriorly ([[Glasser et al. (2016) - Nature#^68a319]])

## Connectivity
- strong connection to [[IFG]], including areas [[BA44, 44]], [[BA45, 45]], [[BA47l, 47l]] ([[Glasser et al. (2016) - Nature#^826543]])
