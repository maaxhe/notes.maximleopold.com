Based on the given context, the ventrolateral prefrontal region (vlPFC) is involved in both the generation and regulation of emotion through different subcortical pathways. It is specifically implicated in the cognitive regulation of emotion and is associated with reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images. The vlPFC plays a role in mediating the association between its activity and reappraisal success, which refers to the reduction in reported emotion. It is connected to the [[nucleus accumbens]], which predicts greater reappraisal success, and the ventral amygdala, which predicts reduced reappraisal success or more negative emotion. Overall, the ventrolateral prefrontal region is involved in the appraisal processes of emotion regulation.
