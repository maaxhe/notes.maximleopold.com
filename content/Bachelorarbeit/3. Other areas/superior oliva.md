## superior oliva

### Sound localization 
Sound localization in the superior olivary complex is achieved through the following mechanisms:

- **Binaural sound localization** involves the integration of sounds received at both ears to locate the source of the sound in the environment.

- The **medial superior oliva (MSO)** and the **lateral superior oliva (LSO)** are the two major subdivisions of the superior olivary complex that contribute to sound localization.

#### Medial superior oliva (MSO)
- **Temporal delay** detection:
  - Utilized for **low frequencies** up to 1.5 kHz.
  - Sound waves arriving at both ears with a minimal perceptible delay of **10 microseconds** allow for the detection of a 1-3° angle difference between both ears.
  - This process occurs in the **MSO**, where neurons operate as **coincidence detectors** using a **delay line circuitry**. The different lengths of axons from the two cochlear nuclei to the MSO act as temporal delay lines to compensate for the delayed arrival of sound waves.

#### Lateral superior oliva (LSO)
- **Sound pressure differences** detection:
  - Applied for **higher frequencies**, where the localization is based on the difference in sound pressure levels reaching both ears.
  - This mechanism is primarily processed in the **LSO**, where the majority of units are **ipsilateral excitatory** and **contralateral inhibitory**.
  - The **subtractive response** generated helps in determining the direction of the sound source, with a discrimination down to **1 dB** in sound pressure difference.

- **Topographical variation** in the strength of inhibition within the LSO contributes to the precise localization of sound sources in the horizontal plane.

In summary, sound localization in the superior olivary complex is achieved through the integration of temporal delays and sound pressure differences, with the MSO focusing on low-frequency sounds through temporal delays and the LSO handling high-frequency sounds through sound pressure level differences.
