## dorsolateral PFC

... is the decider, the most rational, cognitive, utilitarian, and unsentimental part of the PFC. It’s the most recently evolved part of the PFC and the last part to fully mature. It mostly hears from and talks to other cortical regions.
It is the part which is responsible for switching tasks. 

DLPFC, a region in the depth of the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), shows both a higher response to suprathreshold images of faces and houses relative to perithreshold images and a correlation with the difference of |Face(t) - House(t)|. This suggests that this brain region integrates sensory evidence from sensory processing areas to make a perceptual decision
