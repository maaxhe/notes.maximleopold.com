### Function

- spatial processing
- Spatial information as a grouping cue for segregating into discrete sounds.
  - Quelle: [[Cohen et al. (2016) - Springer#^05cbf9]]
- the dorsal pathway also contributes to auditory perception; consistent with that notion, activity in the human parietal lobe is modulated by listeners' choices (Cusack 2005).
