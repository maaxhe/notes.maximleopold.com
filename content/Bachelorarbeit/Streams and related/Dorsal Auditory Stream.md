## Dorsal Auditory Stream

### Location 
- starts in [[PPo]] -> [[pSTG]] ([[Ahveninen et al. (2006) - PNAS#^0e5b5f]])
- seems strongly left lateralized (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007) ([[Frühholz (2015) - NeuroImage#^fadf2d]])
- originate in multiple [[STG]] seed regions and prob. terminate in anterior/posterior [[IFG]] (Fruhholz and Grandjean, 2013b) ([[Frühholz (2015) - NeuroImage#^bd4989]])

### Function
- posterior to [[Herschl's Gyrus]] are involved in spatial processing ([[Ahveninen et al. (2006) - PNAS#^f05bb5]]) 
- Spatial information as a grouping cue for segregating into discrete sounds. ([[Cohen et al. (2016) - Springer#^05cbf9]])
- the dorsal pathway also contributes to auditory perception; consistent with that notion, activity in the human parietal lobe is modulated by listeners' choices (Cusack 2005). ([[Cohen et al. (2016) - Springer#^59d7b2]])
- sound-to-motor-mapping (Saur et al, 2008) ([[Frühholz (2015) - NeuroImage#^2be230]])
- processing of temporal auditory sequences (Belin and Zatorre, 2000b; [[Rauschecker & Scott (2009) - Nature Neuroscience]]) ([[Frühholz (2015) - NeuroImage#^2be230]])
